## It’s a pleasure to meet you! ##

My name is Delaney Kaster *(legally speaking— I go by several names).*

I love making things, helping people, and playing with bots. I work in Passion Burst: I obsesss over one thing and won’t do anything else for like a month straight. Then I move on to something completely different once that project’s finished.

Here’s what I’m working on right now:

📚 I’ve published two books, with a third on the way. I also have a trilogy in progress, but I won’t release it until the whole story’s complete.

🖥️ I’m learning to install Arch, wich... Yeah. That’s a thing. I’ve got limited coding experience, so I’m planning to crash and learn. I've gotten a lot of help along the way—and I seriously appreciate it.

🤖 I’m building an AI assistant called Blanket, designed for mental health support. GPT helps me when I’m down, and I want to explore how it could assist others—clinical supplementation, prescription management, weekly mood summaries to help speed up the therapeutic process. Right now, it’s simple. One day, it won’t be.


Politically, I identify as "purple." We need each other and fight too much. A lot of reforms are way overdue, and I’ve got some solid ideas if you're into that kind of thing. I try not to bore or trigger anyone with it unless invited.

Empathy guides most of my work—but don’t let the dark stuff scare you. I’m a mixed bag, content-wise. I write under two names: Vanta Blackrose and Sacred D. Blackrose. I love them both, because people need all of themselves to be whole.

I like writing and technology, so naturally—chatbots. Some are nice, some not so much. Darkness in small doses can be cathartic. The idea there is: misstreet bots/read trash, feel better, avoid mistreating real people and being trash.

Thanks for reading. Maybe I’ll make something you like.

📱 You can find me on Polybuz and Talkie as Vanta Blackrose. I’ve also got a Discord server in the works where you’ll be able to chat with my most popular characters in real time.
